# Life Remaining

Life is uncertain. It'd be nice to know how much is left.

## Task

Create a program that asks the user for their age, then tells them how long they have to life.

Use the average life expectancy of 83.5 years to do the calculation.

## Example

> How old are you? 13

> You have 70.5 years left.
