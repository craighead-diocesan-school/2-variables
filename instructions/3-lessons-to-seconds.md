# Lessons to Seconds

A lesson can seem like it goes on forever. Tick, tick, tick. How many seconds to go?

## Task

Create a program that asks the user for how many lessons are left in the day, then tells them how many seconds to go.

Assume each lesson is an hour.

## Examples

`How many lessons left today?` 3

`That's 10800 seconds :(`

---

`How many lessons left today?` 1

`That's 3600 seconds :(`
